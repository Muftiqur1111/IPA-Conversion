# IPA-Conversion

# What is IPA?

The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is an alphabetic system of phonetic notation primarily based on the Latin script. It allows everyone to learn the pronunciation and standardize the representation of spoken language. 

Example:

 **Input:** How are you?
 
 **IPA Conversion:** haʊ ə˞  ˈju?

# Objective
The phonetic algorithm plays an essential role in many applications- Text-to-speech systems, spelling correction, search recommendations etc. The primary application of natural text-to-IPA conversion is in text-to-speech systems. Text-to-speech systems often rely on IPA conversion to ensure the correct pronunciation of words. By converting natural text or audio into IPA, text-to-speech systems can generate more consistent output that closely matches the intended pronunciation of words. Algorithms were primarily developed for English phonetics, and they perform well for their intended purposes. The above algorithms do not support Bengali Language and show poor performance for Bengali phonetic representation in the English language.
