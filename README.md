# IPA-Conversion

# What is IPA?

The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is an alphabetic system of phonetic notation primarily based on the Latin script. It allows everyone to learn the pronunciation and standardize the representation of spoken language.

# Objective
The primary application of natural text-to-IPA conversion is in text-to-speech systems. Text-to-speech systems often rely on IPA conversion to ensure the correct pronunciation of words. By converting natural text or audio into IPA, text-to-speech systems can generate more consistent output that closely matches the intended pronunciation of words.
